# iowa_houseprice
A prediction model of house prices in Iowa, United States using regression analysis.

Contents:

- Data: features of houses in Iowa, that are standardized.
- Part A: Introducing additional feature Lot Frontage and dealing with missing values. Fit Linear, Lasso and Ridge regression for 3 ways of dealing with missing data to check differences. Eventually, select the best method.
- Part B: Introducing additional feature Lot Shape which is a categorical variable. Fit all regressions. Check for changes in results due to the addition of the two variables.
- Part C: Add two additional features to the data set - House Style and Sale Type. Same method.
- Part D: Choosing the best model.

This project provides an example of how different types of regression can be used to predict house prices. Additionally, it shows the differences in the Linear, Lasso and Ridge regression models through various examples.
